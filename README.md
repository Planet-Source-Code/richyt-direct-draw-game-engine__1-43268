## Direct Draw Game Engine


</div>

### Description

The other day I decided to make a nice little 2D Multiplayer RPG. I started to do it without any engine or anythin, but then I had like 1000 lines of code to load a map...

So I decided to make it a lot easier by making myself a game engine.

With this engine, now all I need to do is Initialize it, add a surface, draw the surface into the engine then draw the engine onto my picturebox in about 5 lines of code.

The engine supports MIDI and WAVE playing

You can have only 1000 surfaces :( awwww

You name the surface so u dont need numbers or anything, supports transparent layers.

And the most usefull thing I know and have'nt seen on any other kind of engine is support of columns and rows, you know when u make tiles or sprites and there all in one big picture and you end up makin code up for it... well not no more!

When you add a surface you specify how many rows and columns there are, if there just 1 picture its just 1 and 1. Then when you draw it on you choose the X, Y, Name, Row and Column. This makes it a HELL OF A LOT EASIER!!!

Anyway, I hope you like it :) Took me quite a while, I started making an API one, finished that but its to slow :( and since theres this the API one seems pointless cos its even harder to use... lol

Please Please Please leave some feedback and vote for it.

It will work for any sort of game that you would use DirectDraw for, in the future i'm hoping to add some more features, but if nobody leaves comments or votes for it... I cant see the point :p

Anyway.... Again..

Enjoy!
